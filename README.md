🚀 Servo Motor Control Project

This project demonstrates how to control 4 servo motors using an Arduino board. The code runs a sweep motion for 2 seconds and then locks all servos at 90 degrees.

🔧 Features
	•	Controls 4 servo motors connected to pins 9, 10, 11, and 3.
	•	Sweeps all servos from 0° to 180° and back for 2 seconds.
	•	Sets all servos to 90° after the sweep and holds their position.

💻 Technologies Used
	•	Arduino UNO
	•	Servo Library
	•	Tinkercad Circuits for simulation

📁 Files
	•	Servo_Motor_Code.ino: Arduino sketch controlling the servo motors.

📝 How to Use
	1.	Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.
	2.	Connect the servos to the appropriate pins.
	3.	Upload the code to your Arduino board.
	4.	Watch the sweep and fixed angle in action!
